### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been programming for years, beginning by teaching myself on an inherited Atari 130XE computer with the PILOT programming language, and later moving onto QBASIC on a curbside-sourced IBM PS/2 computer.  Later, I took classes on Java, C++, C, and assembly language and microcode for various teaching architectures.  I've also dabbled in C#, Go, and PIC assembly, and Inform 7 for interactive fiction.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JS!
